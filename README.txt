# StructureFold
Multiple RNA secondary structures prediction from high throughput RNA structure profiling data

StructureFold is a series of software packages that automates the process of predicting RNA secondary structure for a transcript or an entire transcriptome, with or without the inclusion of constraints on the structure(s) provided by wet bench experimentation. The process consists of mapping the raw reads of RNA structural data on every transcript in the dataset to the transcriptome, getting RT stop counts on each nucleotide, calculating structural reactivities on the nucleotides, and predicting the RNA structures.
